# snail
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/snail

This code is inspired by an exercise I was asked to follow during (or right after) an interview @ systar, banking business it company.

I was asked to develop a java class that would produce a printout of numbers written in a snail-y way i.e. :

1  2  3  4

12 13 14 5

11 16 15 6

10 9  8  7

And develop it in good fashion, implictly suggesting me to tdd it.

I ended with something looking like what we got here on github.
