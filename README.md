# snail
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/snail

This code is inspired by an exercise I was asked to follow during (or right after) an interview @ systar, banking business it company.

I was asked to develop a java class that would produce a printout of numbers written in a snail-y way i.e. :

1&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>
12&nbsp;13&nbsp;14&nbsp;5<br/>
11&nbsp;16&nbsp;15&nbsp;6<br/>
10&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;7

This class, I had to include two public methods to produce a plain text output and an html output, return type had to be String in both methods

And develop it in good fashion, implictly suggesting me to tdd it.

I ended with something looking like what we got here on github.
